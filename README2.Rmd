```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```



The Githubrepo should stay clean and tidy.  
All files will be named in the same scheme:   
  **GruppeX_abreviation**   
   **"Gruppe6_PRT.docx"**  

Since the data for all of the experiments will likely be the same for everyone  
it would be great to include the Data defined as a reasonably named variable or  
file in the repo. If you use R / Python when analyzing the Data well documented   
code is a must for sharing it with others.  
  
Since we all want to benefit from the sharing,  
please make the effort to write nice code.  

# Group Task Distribution:  
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", out.height="75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/Izar Sch√§rf/Desktop/MoBi/Semester_7/BPC-Praktikum/Githubrepo/Group_Task_Table.png")
