BPC-P Git-Repo README
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The Githubrepo should stay **clean** and **tidy**.
All files will be named in the same scheme: 
  + **GruppeX_abreviation** 
  + **"Gruppe6_PRT.docx"**

Since the data for all of the experiments will likely be the same for everyone  
it would be great to include the Data defined as a reasonably named variables or  
file in the repo. If you use R / Python when analyzing the Data **well documented**   
code is a must for sharing it with others.  
  
Since we all want to benefit from the sharing,  
please make the effort to write nice code.
