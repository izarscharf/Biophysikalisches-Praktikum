BPC-P Git-Repo README
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The Githubrepo should stay **clean** and **tidy**. As you can see each group has a folder to store their files in.  

All files will be named in the same scheme: 
  + **GruppeX_abreviation** 
  + **"Gruppe6_PRT.docx"**

Since the data for all of the experiments will likely be the same for everyone  
it would be great to include the Data defined as a reasonably named variables or  
file in the repo. If you use R / Python when analyzing the Data **well documented**   
code is a must for sharing it with others.  
  
Since we all want to benefit from the sharing,  
please make the effort to write nice code.  


**Please do not push too often, finish your work inside your group and only then push it to the repo**    
**you can all imagine the chaos of 60 people pushing and pulling all week long.**     
**This is not supposed to be a git for cooperation but for sharing only.**  

# Group Task Distribution:  

As we can see in the task dist. by the end of week one we should have assembled the entirety  
of the required materials for all experiments, leaving the latter weeks to reformulation and  
finetuning and expansion on previous reports and presentations and analyses.
